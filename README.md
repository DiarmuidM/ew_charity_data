## Repository

This repository hosts Python syntax for downloading charity data from the Charity Commission for England and Wales, and converting the relational database tables (.bcp) to CSV files.

## Pre-requisites

You must have Python installed on your machine. Python is an open source programming language that can be downloaded and installed using the [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python).

We recommended using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) to write and run the Python scripts, but there are other text editors/IDEs available.

## Acknowledgements

The following files convert the relational database tables (.bcp) to CSV files and were produced by [NCVO](https://github.com/ncvo/charity-commission-extract/blob/master/beginners-guide.md):
* bcp.py
* fimport.py

## Final comments

This materials in this repository are free to use, adapt and share. The scripts are in "beta" phase, meaning they are not likely free of error and should continue to be tested by multiple users. This repository is likely to be updated on a semi-regular basis. If you would like to collaborate on developing the repository further, or have an idea for a research project employing these datasets, then don't hesitate to get in [contact](d.mcdonnell.1@bham.ac.uk).
