Data analysis and management:
- Richer descriptives
- New variables for mlogit (e.g. trustees)
- Clean up Register download to create dataset
- Model diagnostics
- I don't know if you thought of it but you can of course transpose the matrix prior to svmat, 
so you have 1 column with 35 rows, etc

I tend to use results this way, and I would typically stack the results from different models below, 
e.g. rows 1-35 for model 1, 36-70 for model 2, etc
Set up that way, you can add extra variables to indicate model and parameter type, 
then use them as 'by', 'over', and 'if' conditions in graphs, e.g. "graph bar (mean) regres if var_id=1, over(model_id) " , etc


Data collection:
- import.py and bcp.py scripts are the work of https://github.com/ncvo/charity-commission-extract
- amend ew_download and fimport to process SIRs data
- amend ew_download to process other months of the Charity Register
